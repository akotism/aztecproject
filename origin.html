                The Aztecs were not born near the Texcoco Lake nor were they called 
                Aztecs originally. They were called the Mexicas lived in a place 
                called Aztlan, surrounded by water. Aztlan is translated to be 
                multiple similar meanings, such as ‘“White Land,” “Land of White 
                Herons,” or “Place of Herons”’ <a class 
                ="cite" href="citations.html"> (Britannica)
                </a>. They left their land because their patron deity, 
                <a class="tabs" href="religion.html">Huitzilopochtli</a>, who was a god unique to the Mexica, ordered the 
                Mexicas to search for a new homeland. A sign of a eagle eating a snake
                 on a cactus would signify the Aztecas that they have found their new 
                 permanent home. This appearance actually is on the national flag of 
                 Mexico.

                <p class="essay" style="text-indent: 4em;"> The Mexica left Aztlan and started on their 200 year search and eventually arrive at Lake Texcoco to see the sign from the gods, an eagle eating a snake. Here, they built the 
                  Aztec Empire and the powerful capital city Tenochtitlan.
